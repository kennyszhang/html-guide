## faq
- what is html?
  - html (hyper text markup language) is a language that tells web browsers how to structure the websites you visit
  - to do this html uses two things: tags and attributes

- what are tags?
  - an html tag is a reserved word surrounded by angle brackets
- for example:

`<p> Hello World! </p>`

- most tags must be opened `<p>` and closed `</p>` in order to function

- what are attributes?
  - attributes contain additional pieces of information inside the opening tag
- for example:

`<img src="panda.jpg">`

- the image source `src` is the attribute of the `<img>` tag
- also this is one of the few tags in html that does not have a closed tag :O

## fun fact
- you can wrap your content with multiple tags, just make sure you close the tags correctly
- for example:

`<strong><em> Hello World! </em></strong>`

- the `<em>` tag has to be closed inside of the `<strong>` tag
